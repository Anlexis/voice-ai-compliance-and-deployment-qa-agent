# ── Caller-context credential screen ──────────────────────────────────────────
#
# Why this runs before invoke(), not inside a node:
#
# The framework's mandatory output gate scans every value of every node result
# for credential patterns, and the backbone's initialize node copies
# input_context verbatim into its own result. So a credential-shaped string
# anywhere in input_context makes the FIRST node of the graph fail, before any
# template code runs. What the caller gets back is an error status with the
# whole answer withheld and nothing that names input_context, the field, or the
# reason. On a hosted conversation the same context is replayed every turn, so
# the session does not recover on its own.
#
# The request cannot succeed either way. Refusing it here does not change what
# is accepted; it turns an opaque failure into an actionable one.
#
# The screen calls the SAME detector the gate calls, on the SAME assembled
# object, so what this adapter refuses and what the gate blocks are one set by
# construction — there is no local pattern list here that could drift from it.
# Scanning field by field composes exactly to scanning the whole mapping (the
# detector recurses through nested dicts and lists itself), which is what lets
# the refusal name the offending field without widening or narrowing the match.
#
# Field NAMES are caller-controlled too, so a name is echoed back only when it
# is short, inert and carries no credential shape of its own; anything else is
# reported by position. The rejected value and the matched text are never
# echoed — not in the response, not in the audit record.
