# PB-7: HITL Interrupt-Propagation Boundary Test
#
# PB-7 verifies that a human-in-the-loop (HITL) interrupt raised inside the
# agent graph propagates ACROSS the backbone / subgraph boundary up to the
# invoking caller — so an external orchestrator can pause the run, collect a
# human decision, and resume it. This behaviour is only meaningful for
# templates that opt into cross-boundary HITL propagation: a main-slot
# GraphNode declaring `propagate_hitl = True`, or an explicit interrupt()
# checkpoint on the 5-node backbone.
#
# This template does NOT enable cross-boundary HITL interrupt propagation:
# HITL interrupts (if any) are handled inside the inner graph only
# (`propagate_hitl = False`), and the backbone runs to completion with no
# interrupt() checkpoint. There is therefore no propagation behaviour to
# assert, so PB-7 ships as a skip stub — a real,
# importable module that skips with a clear reason (never `assert True`),
# ready to be filled in if/when HITL propagation is wired end-to-end.
